# Xlsm


An XLSM file is a **macro-enabled spreadsheet created by Microsoft Excel** for representing spreadsheets that support Macros and is one of the supported formats by __RadSpreadProcessing__.

If you would like to work with Xlsm files in SpreadProcessing, check the [Using XlsmFormatProvider]({%slug radspreadprocessing-formats-and-conversion-xlsm-xlsmformatprovider%}) article.
