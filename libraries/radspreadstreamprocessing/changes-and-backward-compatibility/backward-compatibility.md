# Backward Compatibility



This article lists the breaking changes and how they can be fixed when upgrading from a specific version of the controls to the next one.

## What's Different in 2016 R3  


### Changed

Assemblies with a version number ending with .45 suffix are **not** distributed.

### What to do now

Use the assemblies with a version number ending with .40 suffix. The library doesn't contain code specific for .NET Framework 4.5, thus an additional version is not needed.
